# ðŸš€ Final Production Deployment Instructions

## âœ… **Issue Resolved: Port 2525 Working!**

**Problem**: Port 587 blocked by production server  
**Solution**: Use Maileroo port 2525 (tested working)

```bash
# Test result on production server:
telnet smtp.maileroo.com 2525
# âœ… Connected to smtp.maileroo.com
# âœ… 220 Erb SMTPd ready
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Final Deployment Steps**

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
```bash
cd /home/locallytrip
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Update Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy production environment with working port 2525
cp .env.production .env

# Verify email port configuration
grep EMAIL_PORT .env
# Should show: EMAIL_PORT=2525
```

### 3. Deploy Services
```bash
# Stop and rebuild all services
docker compose down
docker compose up --build -d

# Monitor backend startup
docker compose logs -f backend | head -30
```

### 4. Verify Email Service Working
```bash
# Should see in logs:
# âœ… Email service ready (instead of timeout/error)
# âœ… SERVER SUCCESSFULLY STARTED
# âœ… Database connection established successfully
```

### 5. Test All Endpoints
```bash
# Backend health (should show email: true)
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Story API (original issue)
curl http://localhost:3001/stories/slug/jakarta-street-food

# Public API test
curl https://locallytrip.com/api/stories/jakarta-street-food/
```

## ðŸ”§ **Working Configuration Summary**

### Email Service Settings:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=maileroo
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.maileroo.com
EMAIL_PORT=2525              # âœ… WORKING PORT
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_TLS=true
EMAIL_USER=noreply@locallytrip.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=f25130bd59f1041cb351bd4c
```

### Backend Improvements:
- âœ… Non-blocking email service (won't stop server if email fails)
- âœ… 5-second timeout for email verification
- âœ… Production-safe error handling
- âœ… Proper Docker health check with `BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0`

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results**

### Backend Logs:
```
âœ… Email service ready
âœ… SERVER SUCCESSFULLY STARTED âœ…
ðŸ”— LocallyTrip Backend API running on 0.0.0.0:3001
âœ… Database connection established successfully
âœ… Server is ready to accept connections!
```

### Health Check Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "email": true,
  "database": "connected",
  "uptime": 120.5
}
```

### Story API Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 2,
    "slug": "jakarta-street-food",
    "title": "Jakarta Street Food",
    ...
  }
}
```
