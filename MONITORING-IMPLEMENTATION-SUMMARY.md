## 📊 **MONITORING COMPONENTS**

### **1. Health Monitoring System**
```bash
# Enhanced health checks every 5 minutes
./monitoring/scripts/health-check.sh
```

**Monitors:**
- ✅ Container status (all 5 LocallyTrip services)
- ✅ Database connectivity with connection count
- ✅ API response time and availability
- ✅ Web frontend availability
- ✅ Admin panel availability
- ✅ SSL certificate expiry warnings
- ✅ Performance metrics with thresholds

### **2. Resource Monitoring System**
```bash
# Advanced resource monitoring every 15 minutes
./monitoring/scripts/resource-monitor.sh
```

**Tracks:**
- ✅ Memory usage with alert thresholds (85% warning)
- ✅ Disk usage with alert thresholds (90% warning)
- ✅ CPU load averages
- ✅ Docker container resource usage
- ✅ Network connections
- ✅ Docker system space usage
- ✅ Log file sizes

### **3. Real-time Dashboard**
```bash
# Interactive monitoring dashboard
./monitoring/scripts/dashboard.sh

# Live updating dashboard (refreshes every 5s)
./monitoring/scripts/dashboard.sh --live
```

**Displays:**
- ✅ Real-time container health status
- ✅ Resource usage overview
- ✅ Recent activity logs
- ✅ Quick service availability tests
- ✅ Live updates every 5 seconds

### **4. Alerting System**
```bash
# Intelligent alert management
./monitoring/scripts/alert-manager.sh
```

**Alert Thresholds:**
- ✅ Database: Alert after 3 consecutive failures
- ✅ API: Alert after 5 consecutive failures or >5s response
- ✅ Memory: Alert if usage >85%
- ✅ Disk: Alert if usage >90%
- ✅ SSL: Warn 30 days before expiry, critical at 7 days
- ✅ Pattern detection: Alert on multiple critical events

### **5. Log Management**
```bash
# Comprehensive log collection
./monitoring/scripts/collect-logs.sh

# Daily log aggregation
./monitoring/scripts/aggregate-logs.sh
```

**Log Features:**
- ✅ Container logs collection
- ✅ Deployment logs archival
- ✅ Monitoring logs aggregation
- ✅ System information capture
- ✅ Automated log rotation
- ✅ Compressed archives with timestamps

### **6. Automated Reporting**
```bash
# Weekly HTML reports
./monitoring/scripts/generate-report.sh
```

**Report Contents:**
- ✅ Weekly uptime summary
- ✅ Health check statistics
- ✅ Resource usage trends
- ✅ Alert summary
- ✅ HTML formatted reports
- ✅ Automated generation every Monday

## ⚙️ **AUTOMATION & SCHEDULING**

### **Automated Cron Jobs:**
```bash
# Health checks every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * ./monitoring/scripts/health-check.sh

# Resource monitoring every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * ./monitoring/scripts/resource-monitor.sh

# Alert management every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * ./monitoring/scripts/alert-manager.sh

# Daily log aggregation at 1 AM
0 1 * * * ./monitoring/scripts/aggregate-logs.sh

# Weekly cleanup at 2 AM on Sundays
0 2 * * 0 find ./logs -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +30 -delete

# Weekly reports at 3 AM on Mondays
0 3 * * 1 ./monitoring/scripts/generate-report.sh
```

**To Activate:**
```bash
# Install automated monitoring
crontab monitoring/configs/monitoring-crontab
```
